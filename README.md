## Parallelized Timetable Scheduling using Simulated Annealing and MPI

## Introduction

This project was created because of the need to simplify the process of creating timetables of campus. With that in mind a simple way to get this to work is to use a probabalistic algorithm called Simulated annealing. From after being able to create timetables for one building running the process again on multiple computers at the same time to get timetables for multiple buildings. Additionally adding the ability for having the program to run on IOT devices such as raspberry pi's to lower the cost of such a machine.
